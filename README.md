# Microprocessor-Design-VHDL-
 Complete the design and simulation of the complete CPU in VHDL using the individual files for CPU components 

## Assignment
Complete the design and simulation of the complete CPU.
Deliverables:
- Verilog source Files for the complete CPU
   * A top level Verilog file with instantiations and interconnections for all CPU components. This module may have implementation of basic logic in order to compute for example the next PC value.
   * The Control Unit which will also be instantiated in the top level.
- Test benches for the top level and control unit.
